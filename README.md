# PPL-course
A repository for Principles of Programming Languages course at BGU

This course studies principles underlying the design of programming languages. It has four main objectives:

1. Learning principles of programming languages: elements of programming languages; abstraction means in programming languages; formal definition of programming languages – concrete syntax, abstract syntax, operational semantics; program correctness – type checking and type inference systems.
2. Describing program execution by studying evaluators: interpreters, transformers and compilers. 
3. Comparing programming paradigms: Functional programming, Logic programming and Imperative programming.
4. Learning principles of program design: Abstraction, contracts, modular architecture, testing.
